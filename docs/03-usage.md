## Usage

Create a `docs` folder at the root of your project with the documentation inside
of it.

We recommend naming each section of your documentation as `01-name.md`,
`02-name.md`, etc.

Start the section with a `title` and then with the content

```
## title

this is an example
```

After writing all the documentation, run:

```
$ now-docs
```
