## FAQ

### Do you have clients for different languages?

[JavaScript](https://github.com/zeit/now-client) (official)

At the moment we're focused on our HTTP API endpoints. As time goes by we'll be
featuring here some more of our open-source clients for different languages and
frameworks, as well as those contributed by the community.

If you have written one yourself, please let us know!

### Can I launch tasks that don't listen on a port?

Absolutely! Your deployments can be used to run tasks, builds, tests. Exposing a
HTTP server is optional.

### What are my deployment limits?

The deployment limits are the same as your account. For special needs, please
