GH polls is a quick and effective way to request feedback from community members
in GitHub issues.

GH polls uses SVG poll options with live data & cache invalidation to keep
everyone up to date. Here's a live real-world example from
[Apex Up](https://github.com/apex/up/issues/4) asking users which platform
they'd like to see supported:
